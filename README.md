# Portfolio-Website

Welcome to my portfolio. Running my project is simple. Click and hold any of the pages (I recommend the index.html file so you start at the beginning), and drag it into your web browser. It will open up the file that you opened and from there you can travel to the other pages. All links are working correctly as well as the contact page, so feel free to check out all my projects and websites. Contact me via the contact page for any questions.

Side note: I did not add an image of myself because I do not have a professional headshot done yet. I will update this project and add one once I have the chance to use in my professional life.
